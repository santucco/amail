The amail program is a replacement of classic Acme's Mail program.

Amail uses upas/nfs to parse the mailboxes. 
By default it shows a list of IMAP mailboxes with a number of unread messages 
and a total number of messages. 
Mailboxes can be opened by clicking by the right button on a name of mailbox.

Also mailboxes can be specified like command line arguments, 
in this case the main window with other mailboxes won't be shown.

By default only new messages are shown in the mailbox's window. 
All messages can be viewed by clicking of the middle button on ShowAll command 
in the tag of the mailbox's window.
All messages are shown in a threaded mode (default) which can be switched off/on 
by clicking of the middle button on ShowPlain/ShowThreads.

Initial view modes can be specified locally for the current mailbox or 
globally for all mailboxes in the main window or via the command line. 

Viewing of messages is processing like in Mail: by clicking of the right button
on a number of message. Few messages can be selected for opening

New messages are marked by "(*)", a thread levels of a message are marked by "+".
 Both marks can be redefined via command line.

A mailbox's tag can contain next commands:
- "Mail" opens a window to compose a new mail.
- "Delmesg" marks messages for removing, messages have to be selected explicitely.
- "UnDelmesg" cleans removing marks, messages have to be selected explicitely.
- "Put" removes marked messages from a server. Open messages won't be deleted.
- "Thread" shows a thread contains a specified message.
- "ShowAll" shows all messages.
- "ShowNew" shows new messages only.
- "ShowPlain" switches to plain mode.
- "ShowThreads" switches to threaded mode.
- "Search" finds messages with specified text.

A message's window tag can contain next commands:
- "Q Reply all" makes a reply, with quoted source message, 
if "Q" and to all recipients if "Replyall" or "Reply all".
- "Delmesg" marks the message for removing and closes the window.
- "UnDelmesg" clears the mark for removing.
- "Html" shows an html version of the message if any.
- "Text" shows a text version of the message if any.
- "Browser" saves a html version of the message and its files on a disk 
and plumbs a path to the message on the disk to web browser.
- "Up" opens a parent message
- "Down" opens a first child message
- "Prev" opens a previous message on the same level of a thread
- "Next" opens a next  message on the same level of a thread
- "Save" stores the message to a specified mailbox.

Like in Mail, when composing a mail message or replying to a message, 
the first line of the text is a list of recipients of the message, 
separated by comma.

"To:", and "CC:", and "BCC:" lines are interpreted as usual. 

"Include:" file places a copy of file in the message as an inline MIME attachment.

"Attach:" file places a copy of file in the message as a regular MIME attachment.

When replying to a message without quoting of the message amail will always
"Include:" the original message; delete that line if you don't want to include it.

There are some known problems, for the moment most of them are addressed to mailfs,
some to Acme:
1. Quite big random access time to messages (according to the sources
mailfs always find a message by sequental comporation) (fixed in bitbucket.org/santucco/plan9port)
2. Mailboxes other that mbox are not refreshing (it seems mailfs doesn't make
subscription on mailboxes other, that INBOX).
3. "Browser" command shows international messages in wrong encoding
(mailfs translates the body of the message to utf-8, but doesn't change
"charset" of the message to utf-8). (fixed in bitbucket.org/santucco/plan9port)
4. There is a big response time after printing of a lot of text.
There is no way to limit events, text insertion events take a lot of CPU
on old computers. (fixed in bitbucket.org/santucco/plan9port)
5. Sometimes Acme exits with an error:
"acme: endofframe: No such file or directory". It happens when an output is
producing in a hidden Acme's window (tag?)
6. When "addr" files are written in few windows simultaneously, sometimes
Acme returns an error "address out range". So messages cannot be refreshed or
erased in two windows. (fixed in bitbucket.org/santucco/plan9port)
